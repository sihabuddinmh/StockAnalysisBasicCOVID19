Due to the global pandemic, there was a surge for work from home (WFH) and online classes. Two companies that weren't popular years ago became household name. They also declared IPO in 2020.The companies are Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM) and Asana (NYSE: ASAN). I will be analysing Stock data from Oct 2020 to Dec 2020. This project will showcase my skills in matplotlib, pandas, and numpy. Please don't infer financial trading advice from this analysis.
